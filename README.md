# wikitext-j
I made use of This program for scraping tool for extracting texts from the set of verified Featured articles on Japanese Wikipedia.
In order to adapt charcters to 'jisx0208', this program uses cnvk.py (https://github.com/yuka2py/cnvk/blob/master/cnvk.py) and unicode.txt, please download these files.
This program is low versatility, so I would appreciate if you used it as a reference.
